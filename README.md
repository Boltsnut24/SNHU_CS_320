**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**
By writing test cases to fit each requirement of our software we can be sure it is functional as we write it. It also allows us to ensure we don't create new problems later on that adversely effect a previous requirement we thought we had already tackled since the test case will fail we've implemented them properly. This provides for a cleaner environment to develop in as fewer messes get created that then create new problems for us to solve when we could be working on something else to push our program closer to it's goals.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**
By writing a list of requirements that solve our user's needs we can give ourselves concrete obstacles to tackle. It can be helpful to break these into smaller and smaller chunks until we can get each one down to a single test case. That collection of test cases at the end serves as a check that we are solving the user's problems so long as we were thorough in our process of converting those into requirements.

**How do I approach designing software?**
I like to start by listing the requirements to solve the end goal of the software. Then I break those into smaller, more manageable chunks. From there I can write small sections of code at a time, testing as I go to make sure the code is really functioning the way I intended for it to. By the time I've written these smaller pieces of code, it's time to tie them together so they can work with one another to solve the greater problem. I typically find this is the portion I end up having new ideas and possibly rework or tweak the code I've written to more efficiently fulfill the requirements. I think with more experience I will get better at listing more thorough requirements at the beginning and mitigate much of this reworking.
